# SmartBasket-Grocery-Store-Management-System
  SmartBasket is a Java-based Grocery Store Management System designed to simplify 
the online grocery shopping process for customers while providing administrators 
with full control over product inventory, orders, and payments.

**The project offers:**
1) Customer-Friendly Interface: Easy browsing, searching, and
ordering of grocery products.
 2) Admin Dashboard: Manage inventory, process orders, and
track sales efficiently.
 3) MySQL Database: All data, including users, orders, and
payments, is securely stored and managed in a centralized MySQL
database.
The system is console-based but can be extended to a graphical or web
application in the future.

1)Customer Operations:
  ï‚· Register / Login: Create an account or log in with existing
    credentials.

  ï‚· Sales Reports: Generate summaries of revenue and product sales.
  ï‚· Delivery Tracking: Mark orders as "Shipped," "Delivered," etc.

3)Database Operations:
  ï‚· The system uses MySQL to store all business data.
  ï‚· It handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for
    customers, products, and orders.
  ï‚· Relationships between tables ensure proper mapping of customers,
    orders, and payments.

  ï‚· Database Tables:
    Note: PK â†’ Primary Key (unique identifier for each record).
          FK â†’ Foreign Key (used to link tables together).
          The design follows database normalization principles for improved efficiency and reduced redundancy.
